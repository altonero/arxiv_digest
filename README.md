# arxiv_digest

Python script that scrapes the arXiv.org "New submissions" web page of any specific research subject, from "astro-ph" to "econ".  The code allows the user to find papers that contain a specific keyword in the title and/or papers that have been written by a specific author. The users can ask the code to send an email to themselves with the results of their search.
